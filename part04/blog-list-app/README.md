# Blog List App

In the exercises for this part, we will be building a blog list application, that allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet.

For each listed blog we will save:

- author
- title
- URL
- amount of upvotes from users of the application.

  - [x] Application turned into a functioning npm project + executed with nodemon.
  - [x] Database created on MongoDB Atlas (using the same database from the previous part's exercises).
  - [x] 3 Blogs added to the list withVS Code REST
